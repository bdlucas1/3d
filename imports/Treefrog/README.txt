# Summary

Red Eyed Treefrog, so you can decorate your garden pound without the noise, or check the calibration of your printer in the most cute way!  
NO Commercial use and NO Derivatives allowed. See creative commons and instructions.  


# Instructions

This was my first model for 3D printing, that I made in order to understand what are the limitation of 3D printing, and compare different printers.  

It's made purely for checking out the quality of your prints and therefore for personal home use, NO Commercial, please. If you intend to display this print result on photos/video/websites, Contact me about it. Thanks!  

UPDATES:  
due to a number of problems related to the past models, this one should solve every issue. Also should be able to print well even with lower settings. Let me know if further modification are needed!
